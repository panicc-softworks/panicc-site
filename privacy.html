			<h1 style="padding-top:20%; color:rgb(218,47,249);">Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>The date of the last version of the policy is 07/06/2020.</p>
			<h2>What terms do we use in Privacy Policy?</h2>
			<p><strong>Personal data</strong> – data of a person who can be identified by the use of such data. This
				Privacy
				Policy explains how we use the personal information you provide to us.</p>
			<p><strong>PS/We</strong> – Panicc Softworks pc. with registered office in Aigaleo, Iera Odos 298, Athens
				Greece
				with TIN: 801166190.</p>
			<p><strong>You, Yours</strong> – any natural person whose Personal data we process and to whom this Privacy
				Policy
				applies.</p>
			<p><strong>GDPR</strong> – Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27
				April 2016
				on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
				movement of
				such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).</p>
			<p><strong>Website</strong> – our website and its subpages: <a href="https://www.paniccsoftworks.com"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paniccsoftworks.com</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Recipients</strong> – entities to whom we may transfer a part of your personal data, in
				connection with
				the performance of certain activities or services by them on our behalf. They may not do anything about
				your
				personal data until we have instructed them to do so, and only to the extent we have indicated. They
				will store
				your personal data securely and only for as long as we indicate or as required by applicable law.</p>
			<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong> – this policy sets forth the principles governing cookies and processing
				and
				protection of personal data.</p>
			<h2>Who will be your data controller?</h2>
			<p>The controller of your Personal data: we. This means that we decide for what purpose
				the personal data you have provided to us are processed. We want you to know that we make every effort
				to keep
				your personal data safe. We do not provide personal data entrusted to us for a fee. You can contact us
				directly
				for information regarding the protection of your personal data at: <a
					href="mailto:info@paniccsoftworks.gr">info@paniccsoftworks.gr</a>.</p>
			<h2>What data are we talking about?</h2>
			<p>This includes personal data collected as part of your use of our services, including the services and
				other
				functionalities provided by PS on the Website and stored in cookies that are installed on our website,
				as well
				as the data we have obtained from publicly available sources, such as social media or through third
				parties that
				have suggested that we contact you. If you then decide to cooperate with us, additionally there will be
				all
				personal data you provide us with.</p>
			<h2>For what purposes, on what legal grounds and for how long do you process personal data?</h2>
			<p>In connection with our business, we process various persons’ personal data for different purposes, to
				different
				extent and on different legal basis specified in the GDPR. In order to provide you with as clear
				information as
				possible, we have grouped this information together, referring to the legal basis for processing your
				personal
				data.</p>
			<p>We process your personal data for the purposes set out below on the <strong>basis of a legitimate
					interest (Art.
					6.1(f) GDPR)</strong> of the PS, which is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>marketing activities provided for you, including the PS own services marketing;</li>
				<li>contacting you to answer your question via the Website (e.g. contact form, chat), e-mail, social
					media or
					any other available means of communication, and with your consent by e-mail and telephone;</li>
				<li>ensuring the security of the services provided electronically, including preventing fraud and abuse,
					and
					ensuring the security of traffic;</li>
				<li>conducting research and analysis of PS, among other things, to assess the main interests and needs
					of
					visitors to our websites;</li>
				<li>evaluation of payment reliability in connection with the conclusion and performance of a contract or
					cooperation binding on us;</li>
				<li>debt recovery; conducting mediation, court and arbitration proceedings;</li>
				<li>carrying out statistical analyses;</li>
				<li>storage of data for archiving and accountability purposes (i.e. to fulfill legal obligations).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We retain personal data for these purposes to such processing.</p>
			<p>If you choose to enter into an agreement with us, we will process your personal data to the extent
				necessary to
				carry out the processing. This applies both to contracts concluded within the framework of providing
				services by
				electronic means (e.g. sending a newsletter or an e-book) and to cooperation contracts or provision of
				services.
				If in connection with the <strong>contract concluded (Article 6.1(b) GDPR)</strong> it appears necessary
				for us
				to process personal data which have been made available or entrusted to you (the data of your
				Customers), we
				shall conclude with you an appropriate data protection agreement (DPA), which shall constitute a legal
				basis for
				the processing of such data by us.</p>
			<p>We shall retain the personal data provided to us under the contract for the contract duration and also on
				its
				termination for the following purposes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>pursue any claims relating to the performance of the contract;</li>
				<li>prevention of fraud and abuse;</li>
				<li>statistical and archiving;</li>
				<li>or a maximum of the limitation periods provided for by law after the contract termination.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additionally, <strong>the law</strong> <strong>(Article 6.1(c) GDPR)</strong> requires us to process your
				data
				for tax and accounting purposes. We will retain this information for as long as required by law.</p>
			<p>If <strong>you give your consent (Article 6.1(a) GDPR)</strong>, we will process your personal data for
				the
				purpose of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>storing data in cookies, collecting data from websites,</li>
				<li>adding comments to the website (e.g. on our blog).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will retain personal data collected based on your consent until it is revoked or the purpose it was
				processed
				for has been achieved or until it becomes obsolete. You can withdraw your consent to the processing of
				personal
				data at any time by sending an e-mail to: <a
					href="mailto:info@paniccsoftworks.gr">info@paniccsoftworks.gr</a>.</p>
			<h2>To whom can we share the data?</h2>
			<p>Subject to applicable law, we may share your data with other controllers or transfer it to processors
				whom we
				commence to process the data, such as hosting providers, cloud computing providers, marketing agencies,
				subcontractors of our services (such as accounting and legal services) and entities entitled to obtain
				data
				under applicable law, such as courts or law enforcement agencies, only if they make a request on an
				appropriate
				legal basis, of course.</p>
			<h2>Is providing personal data voluntary?</h2>
			<p>Providing your data is voluntary. We require you to provide personal data only at the stage of entering
				into an
				agreement with us (e.g. in the scope of sending a newsletter or e-book), and then in connection with the
				need to
				settle it (i.e. for accounting, tax or protection against claims).</p>
			<h2>What are your rights regarding your data?</h2>
			<p>In connection with the processing of personal data, pursuant to the principles set forth in the
				provisions on the
				protection of personal data, including the GDPR, you are entitled to certain rights, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>the right to access your data</strong>, i.e. the right to obtain confirmation from the PS as
					to
					whether or not your personal data is being processed by us, or to obtain a copy of your personal
					data. This
					is to ensure that you are aware of and able to check how the PS uses your personal data. We may
					refuse to
					provide a copy of your personal information where this could adversely affect the rights of another
					person;
				</li>
				<li><strong>the right to rectification</strong>, i.e. the right to request the PS to rectify any
					personal data
					that is inaccurate or incomplete without delay (e.g. where the PS processes your incorrect name or
					address);</li>
				<li><strong>the right to delete your data (also known as the “right to be forgotten”)</strong> – it
					enables you
					to request the deletion of your personal data if, for example, your data was used illegally, or your
					consent
					was withdrawn (if it was the only reason for processing your data). However, the “right to be
					forgotten”
					does not constitute an absolute right to erasure of personal data as there are certain exceptions to
					this
					right, e.g. where we still need to use the data to establish, pursue or defend legal claims or to
					fulfill a
					legal obligation (e.g. under accounting or tax law);</li>
				<li><strong>the right to restrict processing</strong> – you have the right to prevent us from further
					using your
					personal data if, for example, the PS is in the process of evaluating a request for rectification of
					your
					data. If the processing of personal data is restricted, PS may still store your personal data, but
					may not
					further actively use it (e.g. for the purpose of fulfilling a contract).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To the extent that the processing of your personal data is based on a legitimate interest, you have
				<strong>the
					right to object</strong> to the processing of such data. However, the PS may continue to process
				personal
				data where it is able to demonstrate valid and legitimate grounds for processing overriding your
				interests,
				rights and freedoms or where necessary to establish, pursue or defend a claim.</p>
			<p>To the extent that the processing of your personal data is based on consent, you have the right to
				withdraw your
				consent at any time. The <strong>consent withdrawal</strong> shall not affect the lawfulness of the
				processing
				that has been carried out on the basis of the consent prior to the withdrawal.</p>
			<p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, simply email us at: <a
					href="mailto:info@paniccsoftworks.gr">info@paniccsoftworks.gr</a></p>
			<h2>Do we transfer your data to countries outside the European Economic Area?</h2>
			<p>Your personal data may be transferred outside the European Economic Area subject to appropriate legal
				safeguards,
				such as standard contractual data protection clauses approved by the European Commission or decisions of
				the
				European Commission stating an adequate level of protection (e.g. Privacy Shield).</p>
			<h2>Do we process your data automatically?</h2>
			<p>Please be advised that we do not make automated decisions, including those based on profiling.</p>
			<h2>Use of Google Analytics for website analysis</h2>
			<p>This website operator notifies that in order to collect and analyze aggregated information on the portal
				use, it
				uses the Google Analytics service. Please visit this location to learn more about how this service
				collects and
				processes data.</p>
			<h2>Should I still know something?</h2>
			<p>For matters not covered by these Policy, provisions of law and particularly of the Act on provision of
				services
				by electronic means, the Act on personal data protection, the Civil Code and GDPR shall apply. PS
				reserves the
				right to modify the Policy due to significant reasons. The following shall be deemed significant
				reasons:
				introduction of new, amendments to the existing legislation, adaptation to changes introduced by PS. PS
				notifies of the content of the changes by publishing a notice on the change of Policy at <a
					href="https://paniccsoftworks.com/" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">paniccsoftworks.com</a>. The competent court for any
				disputes arising from the application of this Policy shall be the competent court under the applicable
				laws.</p>
